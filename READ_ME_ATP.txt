You will create a linear regression model that predicts the outcome for a tennis player based on their playing habits. By analyzing and modeling the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) data, you will determine what it takes to be one of the best tennis players in the world.

Provided in tennis_stats.csv is data from the men’s professional tennis league, which is called the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals). Data from the top 1500 ranked players in the ATP over the span of 2009 to 2017 are provided in file. The statistics recorded for each player in each year include service game (offensive) statistics, return game (defensive) statistics and outcomes.

Perform exploratory analysis on the data by plotting different features against the different outcomes. What relationships do you find between the features and outcomes? Do any of the features seem to predict the outcomes?

Use one feature from the dataset to build a single feature linear regression model on the data. Your model, at this point, should use only one feature and predict one of the outcome columns. Before training the model, split your data into training and test datasets so that you can evaluate your model on the test set. How does your model perform? Plot your model’s predictions on the test set against the actual outcome variable to visualize the performance.

Create a few more linear regression models that use one feature to predict one of the outcomes. Which model that you create is the best?

Create a few linear regression models that use two features to predict yearly earnings. Which set of two features results in the best model?

Create a few linear regression models that use multiple features to predict yearly earnings. Which set of features results in the best model?
